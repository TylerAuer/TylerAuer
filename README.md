# Hi, I'm Tyler Auer

I'm switching to software development after 12 years in education as a teacher coach and teacher of math, science, and technology to elementary, middle, and high school students.

I can build full-stack apps and love learning. I'm familiar with React, Express, JavaScript, Node, Postgres, Python, HTML, CSS, Sass and more! [Hire me](https://tylerauer.com/)!
