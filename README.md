# Hi, I'm Tyler Auer

I've been teaching for over a decade (math, science, tech to elementary, middle and high school students) and am changing careers to web development.

I can build full-stack apps and love learning. I've worked with HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, React, Node, Express, Postgres, Python and more! [Hire me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-auer-903b481a1/)!
