# Hi, I'm Tyler Auer

I've been teaching for over a decade (math, science, tech to elementary, middle and high school) and am changing careers to web development.

I can build full-stack apps and love learning. I've worked with HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, React, Node, Express, Postgres, Python and more!

## Projects

As I build my skills I've build a few projects:

- **[Portfolio](https://tylerauer.com/)** ([code](https://github.com/TylerAuer/TylerAuer.github.io))
- **[Mountains of Code Blog](https://blog.tylerauer.com/)** ([code](https://github.com/TylerAuer/blog))
- **[Purple Bookshelf](https://books.tylerauer.com/)** ([code](https://github.com/TylerAuer/bookshelf))
- **[The Finch (Blog for Students)](http://thefinch.press/)** ([code](https://github.com/TylerAuer/theFinch))
