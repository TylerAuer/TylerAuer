# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tyler Auer

I taught myself to code after 12 years of teaching math to elementary and middle schoolers. Now I'm a software engineer at Nextdoor[nextdoor.com] where I've worked on user profiles, privacy settings, notification infrastructure, internal tools, and tons of other fun stuff.

I love learning and supporting others as they grow. Find me on LinkedIn[https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-auer-like-hour/]
